# Readme
This repository contains a scientific article written in LaTeX, under the IEEE standard. The article is entitled "Interplanetary Communication" and focuses on the challenges of creating an interplanetary network, particularly for the colonization of Mars.

## Article Summary
The exploration of space and the possibility of colonizing other planets have always been an intriguing topic. Mars, in particular, has been considered a potential candidate for such colonization, due to its proximity to Earth and some of its characteristics that make it relatively habitable for humans. However, creating an interplanetary network that is capable of connecting Earth to Mars and supporting human life on the red planet poses many challenges.

This article first discusses the current communication technologies used in space missions, highlighting their limitations. It then explores the impact of superior solar conjunctions on communications. Finally, the article discusses the prospects for improving interplanetary communication, highlighting recent advances in the field, such as the Relay satellites on Lagrange points, and stressing the importance of international cooperation for creating an efficient and sustainable interplanetary network.
